Select a tentative topic which you plan to research on and plan an outline of it with the idea. You can change the topic later while you go through the submissions but do not worry about it now. Create a Google Slide which should contain, an Introduction, slides regarding the topic, related research, challenges, what you plan to do and conclusion. **All the slides must have page numbers.**

Now present the slide by screen recording it. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.
