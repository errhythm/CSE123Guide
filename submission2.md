[!badge Individual Work]

Now we will be working with the second paper we selected on `submission1`. Create a Google Slide covering the **second research paper**. **All the slides must have page numbers.**

Now present the slide by screen recording it. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

Then you have to write an one page report of the paper. The report format will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/blob/main/submission1/Report.pdf).

Create a folder named `submission2` in your repository and make a text file named `README.txt`. Then paste the generated text in the GitHub and copy the link of your folder. Upload the research paper PDF in the same folder. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission2).

Now update your Course Spreadsheet Task 2 cell with the given sample. After that submit it in Google Form as well.
