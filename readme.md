## Introduction

Welcome to the course! The course is designed to help you immerse yourself in the topic in depth and develop an interest in learning more about it. You will conduct research on this topic and write a research paper on it. You can even publish that research paper so the world can read your great research! We’ll come back to that later.

The course consists of 6 submissions and 2 bonus submissions. If you are able to complete them within the deadline, they will be very easy and enjoyable. However, if you try to finish them in the last week of the semester, they might be very stressful. Let’s learn about each submissions. You will be able to get detailed info from the course spreadsheet, but I think it could be a supplementary guide for the submissions. Completing all 6 submissions will lead to you submitting a research paper in a conference for publishing.

## Things to do before the submissions

- Create a GitHub Repository naming your course code e.g. CSE707. In case if you are not familiar with Github, you can either watch [Youtube](https://youtu.be/xmK1Q5uzH4w), or use my [GitHub template repository](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/generate) to make one for you.
- Create a YouTube Playlist naming your course code e.g. CSE707. You must make sure the playlist is not public, but **unlisted**.
- Create an Overleaf account if you don’t have any.
- [Optional] It is very much appreciable to go with your own pace and learn more things out of the class. You can start a course on Coursera, Udemy or any other platform about the topic to learn which will help you later for bonus. [Here](https://www.classcentral.com/report/free-certificates/) is a list of sites with [Free courses with certificates](https://www.classcentral.com/report/free-certificates/).
- Form a team and write the info in Course Spreadsheet.
