[!badge Individual Work]

At first you have to select 2 papers related to your course contents. You will have to submit the paper links in the relevant Google Form which will be given in Slack and that way you can ensure your chosen two papers are unique and were not chosen by others. The paper must be published in or after 2022. Create a Google Slide covering the **first research paper**. **All the slides must have page numbers.**

Now present the slide by screen recording it. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

Then you have to write an one page report of the paper. The report format will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/blob/main/submission1/Report.pdf).

Create a folder named `submission1` in your repository and make a text file named `README.txt`. Then paste the generated text in the GitHub and copy the link of your folder. Upload the research paper PDF in the same folder. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission1).

Now update your Course Spreadsheet Task 1 cell with the given sample. After that submit it in Google Form as well.
