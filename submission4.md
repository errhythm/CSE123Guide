We will start working on our research project from this submission. Find a suitable title for your research project, write abstract of it. Also complete the Introduction and the initial literature review of your research. Then plan the methodologies and give a brief description of them. Basically complete the 1st draft of your research paper in the Overleaf Project we opened in Submission 3. Also consult your assigned ST & RA frequently about your research and they will be glad to help you.

Now present the first draft of your research paper by screen recording it. You can either make a Google Slide or present the paper from overleaf directly, any of them works. Then, upload the presentation video in YouTube making it **unlisted** in privacy settings. Then add the video in the Unlisted YouTube playlist we made earlier.

Create a folder named `submission4` in your repository and make a text file named `README.txt`. The format of the repository and the `README.txt` will be like the given [sample](https://github.com/errhythm/CSE123/tree/main/submission4). Copy and paste the sample text in the GitHub then fill it up and copy the link of your folder.

Now update your Course Spreadsheet Task 4 cell with the given sample. After that submit it in Google Form as well.
